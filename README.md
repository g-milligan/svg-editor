This project has changed. It no longer focuses exclusively on SVG. 

Now, I'm working on a javascript/jQuery plugin called cleanEditor. 

You can see a working demo and description on the gh-pages branch, here:

Grand ideas: 

Create points in which custom syntax highlighters can be hooked into the cleanEditor. If I write a JSON file, I should be able to use it as a customized code highligher. 

More... I would like to allow developers to access their own personal code snippets and code libraries; for example, you could key-bind access to a reusable set of boilerplate code snippets, downloaded as part-of (NOT all of) a git repo. 

I want to create a repo where...
- I can just throw all of my code snippets into a pile, 
- add a manifest file, that identifies individual snippets so that my code editor can download them individually, at the stroke of a configurable key-binding. 
- Perhaps even integrate yeoman projects and grunt tasks into a full on editor. 
- Code snippets can be highlighted and then uploaded to a shareable library (in Git) from editor menus. Maybe <a target="_blank" href="http://yeoman.io/authoring/integrating-yeoman.html">integrate</a> "File New" with the ability to choose from a starting template that you or someone else created.

More mind vomit: Since this editor is written with web scripts, I may experiment with creating an in-the-cloud version that's free and publicly accessible as a normal web page. Maybe my head's the only thing in "the cloud". But I want put this idea out there before I find out it's already been done better by someone else ;) I will try and check my ego at the door because I'm hoping that some day one of these side projects will gain momentum. If you are more succesfful at this, please make your documentation friendly and easy to understand.

But first things first. I'm working on the basic functionality. Feel free to use my code or poke holes in it. Now, I have an abundance of holes and no substance. But hopefully, that will change. This experiment may fail, but now I'm enjoying coding. What do you have to add? Is there a library for this that's way better than anything I could hope to write already?
